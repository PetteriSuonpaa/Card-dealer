This project was developed as part of the course **KON-C3003 â€“ Mekatroniikan harjoitustyÃ¶ (5 ECTS)**.  
I was responsible for **electronics design** and served as the **team leader**.  

The system automates card distribution using an **Arduino Uno**:  
- A **DC motor** dispenses cards.  
- A **stepper motor** rotates to position them accurately.  
- Users set **player count** and **card count** via **potentiometers**, displayed on an **OLED screen**.  
- Dealing starts with a **push button**.

## ðŸ”¨ Building Process  
1. **Rough Sketching** â€“ Initial concept drawings and brainstorming ideas.  
2. **Prototyping Mechanisms** â€“ Testing different mechanical approaches on a small scale.  
3. **Full-Scale Prototype** â€“ Developing a functional prototype for testing.  
4. **Final Product** â€“ Refining and completing the final version based on results.

## ðŸ’¡ Discussion & Future Improvements  
The card dealer successfully achieved the desired functionality. Throughout the project, we gained valuable insights into designing and refining simple mechatronic systems.  

**Future improvements could include:**  
- Designing a **custom PCB** for better integration and reliability.  
- Creating **modular parts and code** for easier updates.  
- Adding an **On/Off switch or fuse** for safety.  
- Using **bolts/screws instead of glue** for durability.  
- Implementing a **cooling system** to prevent overheating.  
- Refining the **mechanical design** for smoother operation.
